Algorithms: Design and Analysis (I)
===================================

### July 1st 2013 Session

This repository contains all my solutions to Coursera's [Algorithms: Design and
Analysis Pt.1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo) (Stanford University)
programming assignments.

The course is language-agnostic and we are encouraged to use whatever language
we want to implement the required algorithms. I will use Python for all these
assignments.
